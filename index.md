## About
The goal of the AI4ESS Web Portal is to connect members of NCAR's community of researchers and students with resources to aid in learning about and developing machine learning solutions for Earth System Science problems. 

## Tutorials
* [AMS Machine Learning in Python for Environmental Science Problems (January 2018)](https://github.com/djgagne/ams-ml-python-course): Jupyter notebooks introducing basic machine learning and deep learning concepts. 
* [AI4ESS Summer School (June 2020)](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/events/summer-school/ai4ess/2020): This event features recorded lectures and hackathon challenge problems covering introductions to machine learning and deep learning, applications of AI to ESS problems, and emerging areas of AI research.
* [Trustworthy AI for Environmental Science Summer School (July 2021)](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/events/past-training-workshops/tai4es): This event features recorded lectures covering different aspects of trustworthy AI, including explainable AI, physics-based AI, robust AI, ethics, and R2O. 
* [XAI Short Course (April 2021)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lqpABwDl3kPe6ThE-NIDR64PimnltJEuKNkysDZuWKQ/edit): An in-depth introduction to different explainable AI methods with presentations, lecture recordings, and Google Colab notebook examples. 

## Software

### External Packages
